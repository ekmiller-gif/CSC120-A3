Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I consulted Elizabeth Sarpong and Tho Ngyuen while working on this assignment to brainstorm and debug our programs.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I attended TA hours on Monday 2/16.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    While the actual logic of the programming is very similar, I found the syntax much more confusing than in Python when I was first learning it. The syntax in Python is much simpler, and to me at least, a lot more intuitive. I had to look to the java documentation site, Think Java, and geeks for geeks quite a bit. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
