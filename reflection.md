Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I consulted Elizabeth Sarpong and Tho Ngyuen while working on this assignment to brainstorm and debug our programs.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I attended TA hours on Monday 2/16 and Tuesday 2/17 - I got help from Sofia and Binah!

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    While the actual logic of the programming is very similar, I found the syntax much more confusing than in Python when I was first learning it. The syntax in Python is much simpler, and to me at least, a lot more intuitive. I had to look to the java documentation site, Think Java, and geeks for geeks quite a bit. 
    I also often got confused with the brackets needed to nest lines of code. I felt like I was always tracking down a missing or unneccessary braket.
    I understand its benefits over python, but its really hard right now!

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I'm kinda bad at extracting general/abstract ideas from stuff like this, but it seems like Java requires more precision but is more suited to more complex interfaces.
    
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I do recommend following the order given in the A3 introdcution video (make it run the correct number of rounds first, then have it give random responses, then be able to mirror responses) rather than trying to do it all at once, because it allows to to test your code as you go since you have a program that runs at each step and it makes it easier to spot bugs and logical errors. I did the first two steps on my own and didn't have any problem until I reached the third step (which got super hard!) but I was able to go to TA hours and compare the parts of my code that did work and continuously test my code as I made changes.
